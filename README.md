**Check Issues for HacktoberFest**  

**Breaking Change for development in [#34](https://github.com/TechWiz-3/who-unfollowed-me/pull/34)** - please delete the `~/.unfollow/unfollow.toml` file before running `unfollow` again!

### About

Python CLI tool that shows you who has unfollowed you on GitHub.  
Heavily inspired by [msaaddev/who-unfollowed-me](https://github.com/msaaddev/who-unfollowed-me)  

### Installation

![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/unfollow?style=flat-square&color=blue)

```py
pip install unfollow
```

### Usage

The first time you run the tool, you will be asked to enter your GitHub username. Subsequent runs will show any unfollowers, with names and links.  

I used this project to learn a lot about [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), thus I created numerous themes which you can use.

`unfollow` - colored text and some panels  
`unfollow panels` - colored text inside panels  
`unfollow bubbles` - all text inside beautiful bubbles - requires a nerd font  
`unfollow simple` - no colors or emojis, just plain text and a table - coming soon  

### Inspiration

As mentioned, [msaaddev/who-unfollowed-me](https://github.com/msaaddev/who-unfollowed-me) was the reason I created this project and has been a great reference. While I love the project, three things stood out to me that I wanted to improve in my own implementation:

1. The data files for the tool are not hidden and are stored in your current directory rather than the home directory
2. Output looks good but a huge amount is self promotion rather than actual relevant info. (Please don't get me wrong, everyone can self promote as much as they like, I'm just talking about what I wanted to improve)
3. If the tool is run without internet connection, the file that stores the username is erased

### Development

1. Clone the repo and cd into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/TechWiz-3/who-unfollowed-me.git
cd who-unfollowed-me
```
2. Ensure `poetry` is installed by running:`pip install poetry`
3. Run: `poetry install`
4. Make your changes
5. To test your changes, run: `poetry run unfollow` in project root directory
