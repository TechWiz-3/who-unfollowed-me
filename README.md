## Python Implementation

### About

Python CLI tool that shows you who has unfollowed you on GitHub.  
Heavily inspired by [msaaddev/who-unfollowed-me](https://github.com/msaaddev/who-unfollowed-me)  

### Installation

![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/unfollow?style=flat-square&color=blue)

```py
pip install unfollow
```

### Usage

The first time you run the tool, you will be asked to enter your GitHub username. Subsequent runs will show any unfollowers, with names and links.  

I used this project to learn a lot about [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), thus I created numerous themes which you can use.

`unfollow` - colored text and some panels  
`unfollow panels` - colored text inside panels  
`unfollow bubbles` - all text inside beautiful bubbles - requires a nerd font  
`unfollow simple` - no colors or emojis, just plain text and a table - coming soon  

### Contribute with Development

1. Please check the [HACKING.md](https://github.com/TechWiz-3/who-unfollowed-me/blob/main/HACKING.md) for info on the logical workings of the program
2. All source code within the `src` directory
3. To test the binary is working by running `python setup.py develop`
4. find the binary by running `which unfollow`, if you have the return text with location of the binary so you success to install locally
5. try running with command `unfollow`
6. happy hacking!

### Inspiration

As mentioned, [msaaddev/who-unfollowed-me](https://github.com/msaaddev/who-unfollowed-me) was the reason I created this project and has been a great reference. While I love the project, three things stood out to me that I wanted to improve in my own implementation:
1. The data files for the tool are not hidden and are stored in your current directory rather than the home directory
2. Output looks good but a huge amount is self promotion rather than actual relevant info. (Please don't get me wrong, everyone can self promote as much as they like, I'm just talking about what I wanted to improve)
3. If the tool is run without internet connection, the file that stores the username is erased
